```lrc
[00:19.25] Everybody needs a little time away
[00:26.98] I heard her say from each other
[00:35.92] Even lovers need a holiday
[00:41.02] Far away from each other
[00:53.02] 
[00:47.73] Hold me now
[00:50.98] It's hard for me to say I'm sorry
[00:54.53] I just want you to stay
[01:06.03] 
[01:02.50] After all that we've been through
[01:05.82] I will make it up to you, I promise to
[01:14.53] And after all that's been said and done
[01:19.99] You're just the part of me I can't let go
[01:27.17] Hoo, hoo
[01:31.17] 
[01:32.35] Couldn't stand to be kept away
[01:36.79] Just for the day from your body
[01:45.23] Wouldn't wanna be swept away
[01:51.07] Far away from the one that I love
[02:07.57] 
[01:57.56] Hold me now
[02:00.95] It's hard for me to say I'm sorry
[02:04.63] I just want you to know
[02:11.35] Hold me now
[02:14.04] I really want to tell you I'm sorry
[02:18.50] I could never let you go
[02:30.50] 
[02:25.76] After all that we've been through
[02:29.97] I will make it up to you, I promise to
[02:38.91] And after all that's been said and done
[02:44.28] You're just the part of me I can't let go
[03:04.78] 
[02:52.45] After all that we've been through
[02:56.51] I will make it up to you, I promise to
[03:15.51] 
[03:24.13] You're gonna be the lucky one
